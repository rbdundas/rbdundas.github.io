# Insurance Programming: Automating the Modern Insurance Agency
[APIs](apis.html)

The modern agency has been slow to adopt evolving technologies within the traditional agencies. From my experience most 
agencies were started by successful salespeople, who decided to go it alone and hang their shingle. These producers 
turned entrepreneurs are not known for their technical savvy.

In my opinion, Insurance (Insuretech) is an industry that lags 20 years behind its big brother: Fintech. I have opinions 
as to why this is the case, but I'll save my ramblings for another article. Regardless, we are at a time where the 
traditional business model of Insurance is being turned on its side. For years, I have heard from people who have 
been in the industry for decades are things like "this is a service based industry" and "that's not the way I've always 
done it!", to justify their belief that technology and automation serve no purpose here.
